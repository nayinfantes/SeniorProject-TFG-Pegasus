Here I show you my senior project carried out during the second multiplatform app development course.
<br> <br>
Pegasus is an android parental control app which when installed on the child’s device and linked with his parent’s, will provide the parents remote access to that device, giving them the ability to control, block or manage certain features that can ensure your child’s safety and digital well being.
